Ninety-nine lisp problems based on a Prolog problem list by
werner.hett@hti.bfh.ch. This project is inspired by the page of

http://www.ic.unicamp.br/~meidanis/courses/mc336/2006s2/funcional/L-99_Ninety-Nine_Lisp_Problems.html

However, I found that the links to many solutions are not
accessible. So I decide to rewrite it, just to get more familiar with
elisp.

Since I'm just a newbie, errors and bugs are inevitable. If your find
one, please do me a favor to point it out.

If any of you found it useful, you could use the code freely.
